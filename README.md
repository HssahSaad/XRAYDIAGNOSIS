## Overview
*XRAYDIAGNOSIS* is a deep learning-based medical diagnostic tool that classifies X-ray images into four categories with high accuracy. This project aims to assist medical professionals in making faster and more accurate diagnoses.

---

## Problem Statement
Accurate and timely diagnosis of medical conditions through X-rays is critical, but manual analysis is time-consuming and prone to human error. This project seeks to provide an automated and reliable solution using deep learning.

---

## Project Objectives
- Develop a deep learning model for multi-class classification of X-ray images.
- Achieve high accuracy and reliability in the predictions.
- Contribute to the field of AI-powered medical diagnostics.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- **Tools**: Google Colab, VS code
- **Dataset**: Kaggle

---

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Gathered X-ray image datasets from Public sources.
   - Preprocessed images by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting them.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Built and trained a deep learning model using the Xception architecture.
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize performance.

3. **Evaluation and Validation**:
   - Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Achieved a classification accuracy of 97.24%.

4. **Presentation**:
   - Presented the project at SHE CODE and TEDx events, highlighting its impact and results.
